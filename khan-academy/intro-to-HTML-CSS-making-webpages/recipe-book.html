        <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Finely chop the chocolate into small pieces. The pieces have to be able to dissolve easily in the liquid.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Place the milk into a small, thick-bottomed pot on low heat and bring to a low simmer. Whisk once in a while to ensure that the milk doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Add the vanilla, powdered sugar, salt, and chocolate and whisk vigorously until the chocolate has melted.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Heat for another 4 minutes, constantly stirring.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Heat the pan: Melt the butter or heat the oil  in your skillet over low heat for 1 minute. Use 1 teaspoon of butter or oil per egg if using a nonstick skillet or well-seasoned cast iron skillet. Use 2 teaspoons of butter or oil if you're using a stainless steel skillet.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Cook the egg on the heat: Break the egg into the skillet, and cover the pan with a lid. Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, covered, or until all but a thin rim of egg white around each yolk is opaque.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Finish cooking the egg off the heat: Remove the pan from the heat, keep covered, and let sit for about 30 seconds to finish cooking.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Cook cauliflower florets in salted water: Bring 1 quart of water to a rolling boil in a medium-sized pot. Add 2 teaspoons of salt to the water. Add the cauliflower florets, and cook until cooked through, about 4 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove florets to a bowl. Reserve cooking water.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Purée cooked cauliflower: Working in batches, fill a blender half-way with cooked cauliflower, add enough cooking water to the blender bowl so that it comes up a quarter of the way. Purée until smooth. You want the consistency to be that of soup, so if you need to add more water, do so.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Add salt and butter: or each blender batch, add salt and butter to taste (about 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and about a tablespoon or more of butter for each blender batch). Since you are using only lightly salted cooking water for a base, not stock, you will need to salt this more than you would otherwise.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Serve: Serve immediately into bowls. Drizzle olive oil over the top and sprinkle with chopped chives.</p>
